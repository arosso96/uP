# Description
Development of a basic pipeline based microprocessor design. Following all the design stages, from high level models going down to structural description. Testing all the steps

# Design Stage
Here are described all the design steps that are being followed for the development of this project.
## Requirements
The first step is to define the requirements that the system must have. These will then be used in the testing phase to check that the developed system respects all the initial requests.
### Functional
* RiscV RV32I ISA
* Pipelined
* Forwarding and Stalls Handling (Structural, Data, Control \[see below\])
* Jump Prediction (Predict, Check and Flush the pipeline)
* Debug and Test support (Scan Chain design + BIST)
### Non-Functional
